# Survival_Meals_Expanded
This mod adds more vanilla-friendly survival meals which are progressively more nutritious and ingredient-efficient.
All features are obtained through well-balanced research projects.

Packaged survival meals now require a packaging station to be made. This workbench must be powered and filled with packaging material to operate.

Packaging material can be made with cloth at a tailoring bench.

Survival meals are made with their respective non-packaged meals. Simple meals make packaged survival meals, fine meals make fine survival meals and lavish meals make lavish survival meals. That's a lot of meals!
